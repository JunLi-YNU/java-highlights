Computer and Man
It is believed that the computer can do almost every thing.
At the time the computer was invented, scientists, carried
away by its calculating speed, felt that they had created
a miracle. It Was gradually used not noly in mathematics,
physics,chemisry and astronomy, but in places like the library,
hospital and military army to replace the work of man.
For the work of man. For this reason, the computer was entiled
―Electronic Brain‖ in terms of appreciation.Can man be controlled
by computers? The answer is negative. Although a computer works
much faster and accurately than man , a fact is undeniable;
it is designed, manufactured and programmed by man, and therefore
by human beings. Of course, science fictions have made up many
fascinating stories about a computer, or rather robot,who conquers
man and the earth, even the whole universe; however, they are only
unrealistic imaginatio. A horse helps man a lot runs much faster
than we, but it is only a slave.The future for the computer is very promising.
With the help of it, we can do things that could not be done before.
Conquering the universe, discovering new things, explaining mysteruiys
phenomena puzzling us at present are all made possible by computer.
